I don't have a machine powerful enough to hit the harder to solve puzzles, if you get a winner with the program and feel like donating(I vibe coded this over a period of a couple weeks with Microsoft edge browser) here is a donation address: 34aYRB9jeSDXxNpjZBZpfETLJ2Tcw1H36G

solver.py is the latest build. I bricked a couple laptops and am down to programming these on a raspberry pi 400. I'll have optimized versions for the pi 400 GPU chip as well as creating a version for Intel and AMD chips.

Vibe coded using Microsoft CoPilot with very well tuned prompts. The worker routes and save states are all my own ideas based off of actual puzzle building ideas(outside first and fill in the middle pieces).

Hope this scores someone some coins. I have none currently, feel free to send a tip if you snag a winner with what I pieces together. Happy Hunting!
